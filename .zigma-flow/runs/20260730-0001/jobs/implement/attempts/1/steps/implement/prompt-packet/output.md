Write your report to:

  `.zigma-flow/runs/20260730-0001/jobs/implement/attempts/1/steps/implement/report.json`

This is the canonical step artifact path. Writing to any other location will cause the Engine to reject the report.
This is a runtime artifact file. Writing it does not modify workflow state or repository code; the Engine reads it and owns all state transitions.

### Required Outputs

- `files_changed`
- `summary`

### Required Artifacts

(none declared)

### Allowed Signals

(none)
### Artifact Rules

- Write the Agent report to the canonical report path only.
- Use artifact references for large logs, diffs, test results, and generated files.
- Do not place full large artifact contents in the prompt or report JSON.

### Artifact Reference Schema

Artifacts are referenced in the `"artifacts"` array of report.json using two kinds:

1. **Agent-Created Artifacts** (`path` kind): Files the Agent creates during this step.
   - Must be written to the step's artifact directory.
   - Referenced by relative path from the run directory.
   - Example: `jobs/implement/attempts/1/steps/implement/summary.md`

2. **Existing Evidence Artifacts** (`ref` kind): Artifacts from upstream steps that are evidence for the current step.
   - Already exist at a known path from a prior step in the same run.
   - Referenced by their artifact ID or path.
   - Example: `artifact://20260730-0001/jobs/<upstreamJob>/attempts/<attempt>/steps/<step>/stdout`

The canonical artifact directory for this step is:

  `jobs/implement/attempts/1/steps/implement`

All agent-created artifacts must be placed within this directory.


### Report Schema

The file must be valid JSON with exactly these required top-level fields:

```json
{
  "outputs": {},
  "artifacts": [],
  "signals": [],
  "summary": ""
}
```

- `"outputs"`: current step output values.
- `"artifacts"`: artifact references for large outputs.
- `"signals"`: structured workflow-change requests from the allowed list above.
- `"summary"`: short execution summary.

Complete the current step, write report.json, then stop. 完成当前 step 后停止.
